# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for a telecommunications company. The goal was to identify key factors driving customer attrition and build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize these insights, enabling data-driven decision-making for customer retention strategies.

## Key Insights
- The overall churn rate was **26.86%**.
- **44.92% of churn** was attributed to competitor-related reasons (better offers, devices).
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** churned at a significantly higher rate than those on annual contracts.
- Payment method was a strong indicator; users of **paper checks** had a churn rate of over **55%**.
- Other factors like **international charges** and lack of **tech support** also showed strong correlation with churn.

## Dashboard Features
The interactive dashboard includes:
- A high-level overview of churn rate and customer demographics.
- A detailed analysis of churn reasons and categories.
- Drill-down visuals exploring the impact of contract type, payment method, and account length.
- Filters to dynamically explore data by various customer segments.
